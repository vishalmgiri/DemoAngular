With static tabs , different states  and single controller it works.
With generalized state:
1. Implemented single controller
2. Defined generalized state for tabs .
3. Set parameters specific to tabs.
4. Able to navigate between different states.
5. Not able to navigate between tabs with same state and different parameters.

I have commitetd project to review code. I have documented and indented the code wherever required.
Could please review the code and let us know your feedback.
